## Implementing API's in Angular

"create initial file structure in api calling with angular app. add service for api call, main componenet, api-key file, add the right imports, service parameter"

"read documentation on displaying data from on API call. Add button, declare instance of service in constructor of component."

"started reading through a tutorial (https://thinkster.io/tutorials/angular-2-http) after hitting a wall"

"spent some time reading through different tutorials and comparing my code to previous projects to eventually realize that all I was missing () in the function I was implementing on the button click"
