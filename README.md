# Development Progress

I started the day going through some basic JavaScript terminology (screenshot of vocab list in img folder). This is something that I have felt like I have lacked for awhile. I am able to look at code and know what things are doing, but it's a struggle for me to talk in technical language.

Then, I spent some time looking for some API's so I could figure out how to API call using Angular 2. Couldn't really find anything I was wanting to build with, so I stopped doing that.

After some API searching, I decided to check out the React website (screenshot of tutorial in img folder). Now I am sucked in making a tic-tac-toe app. (https://github.com/tbssnch/online-store.git)

Once I completed the React tutorial, I revisited the online-store project and worked with the edit/delete functionality in Angular. (https://github.com/tbssnch/online-store.git)

Spent the last bit of time left in the day going through an article from Medium(
 https://medium.com/dev-bits/a-perfect-guide-for-cracking-a-javascript-interview-a-developers-perspective-23a5c0fa4d0d) that helped me understand some things to expect and prepare for before heading into an interview.
