# Development Progress

I started the day going through some basic JavaScript terminology. This is something that I have felt like I have lacked for awhile. I am able to look at code and know what things are doing, but it's a struggle for me to talk in technical language.

Then, I spent some time looking for some rad API's so I could figure out how to API call using Angular 2. Couldn't really find anything I was stoked on, so I stopped doing that.

After some API searching, I decided to check out the React website. Now I am sucked in making some tic-tac-toe app and it rules.

Broke for some tacos around noon. They were alright. Back to react-tac-toe.

Finished the tutorial on tic-tac-toe with React. Downloaded the React Developer Extension for Chrome to debug.

After some React fun, I revisited the online-store project and worked with the edit/delete functionality in Angular.
