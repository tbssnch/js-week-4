## Implementing API's in Angular

"create initial file structure in api calling with angular app. add service for api call, main componenet, api-key file, add the right imports, service parameter"

"read documentation on displaying data from on API call. Add button, declare instance of service in constructor of component."

"started reading through a tutorial (https://thinkster.io/tutorials/angular-2-http) after hitting a wall"

"spent some time reading through different tutorials and comparing my code to previous projects to eventually realize that all I was missing () in the function I was implementing on the button click"

after getting results in the console, I hit a wall again getting the results to display on the page. I kept going through the Implementing API's in Angular lesson on Learn How to Program, but couldn't figure out what my issue was. I ended up not needing the ngFor because the API results were an object and not an array. This was a frustrating lesson to learn, but now I know something else to look for if I am not getting the results that I want.

added some styling to the application that I started building today. (https://github.com/tbssnch/moon-api.git)
